    UI[Jetpack Compose UI] --> VM[ViewModel (StateFlow, LiveData)]
    VM --> UC[Use Cases (Business Logic)]
    UC --> REPO[Repository Layer]
    REPO --> DB[Room Database (Offline)]
    REPO --> FIREBASE[Firebase (Auth, Firestore)]
    REPO --> PAYMENT[Stripe API / Google Pay]
    UI Layer (Compose) → Declarative, responsive Material 3

ViewModel → Exposes reactive states via StateFlow & LiveData

Use Cases → Handles business logic (clean separation)

Repository → Firebase + Local DB + Payment API

Offline-first → Room DB + WorkManager ensures reliability
